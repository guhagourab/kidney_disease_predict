 ML can be a powerful tool in predicting kidney diseases, aiding in early detection and effective treatment. However, it’s important to note that these models should be used as a supplement to, not a replacement for, professional medical advice. Always consult with a healthcare professional for medical concerns
Machine Learning (ML) has shown great promise in the field of healthcare, particularly in predicting kidney diseases. Here are some key points:

1. **Predicting Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD)**: ML techniques have been deployed to predict, diagnose, and treat CKD¹. These techniques aim to improve CKD diagnosis and patient management¹. The most common aim was prediction of prognosis, followed by diagnosis of CKD¹. However, the interpretability, generalizability, and fairness of the models need to be addressed to ensure the safe application of such technologies in routine clinical practice¹.

2. **CKD Stage Prediction**: Various researches have been carried out using machine learning techniques on the detection of CKD at the premature stage². The prediction models used include Random Forest (RF), Support Vector Machine (SVM), and Decision Tree (DT)². The results from the experiments indicated that RF based on recursive feature elimination with cross validation has better performance than SVM and DT².

3. **Predicting End-Stage Kidney Disease (ESKD)**: ML has been used to predict the risk of ESKD from patients with CKD⁵. Predictor variables included patients’ baseline characteristics and routine blood test results⁵.

4. **Accuracy of ML Algorithms**: Taking advantage of big data, ML algorithm-based prediction models have high accuracy in predicting kidney disease progression³. These algorithms are recommended as an auxiliary tool for clinicians to determine proper treatment and disease management strategies³.

In summary, ML can be a powerful tool in predicting kidney diseases, aiding in early detection and effective treatment. However, it's important to note that these models should be used as a supplement to, not a replacement for, professional medical advice. Always consult with a healthcare professional for medical concerns.
